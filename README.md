# Discord_ModerationBot

Easy to use ModerationBot for your Discord, it supports a lot of features and no configurations are needed. All you need to edit is the config2.json for the mod/join log channel along with the prefix and token.

Currently supports over fifteen important commands needed for moderation and it also disallows invite links(still being worked on), it can also log the changed nickname of the users, it can also check if the message was edited, etc.. they will all be updated in the mod-log channel while you can keep an eye on your guild easily just because of this bot.

Modules needed:

discord.js
ms
fs

Steps:

Just edit the config2.json with your prefix and your token. Make sure you have the mod channel and the join channel setup and you are ready to go by just starting bot.js in your console.

Note: Expect a faster response from the bot.
